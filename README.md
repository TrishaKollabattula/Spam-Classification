# SPAM CLASSIFICATION Project
## Overview
This project demonstrates various natural language processing techniques to preprocess and analyze textual data. It covers steps from data loading to advanced tokenization and preprocessing, helping users understand how to prepare text for further analysis or machine learning tasks Mainly classifying whether a mail is *spam* or *ham* (not spam).

## Features
Data Loading: Import and visualize datasets for NLP tasks.<br>

Text Preprocessing:<br>
  - Tokenization
  - Lowercasing, punctuation removal, and stopword filtering
  - Lemmatization/Stemming

Tokenization Techniques:  
  - Word level tokenization
  - Tokenization using libraries NLTK <br>
  
Feature Extraction:
- Count vectorization

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Analyze the distribution of spam and ham messages
- Visualize common words in spam and ham categories

Model Implementation:
- Use a machine learning algorithm: Naive Bayes

Performance Evaluation:
- Evaluate the model using metrics: score

Integration:  
- Easy-to-replicate modular code structure for use in various projects.
